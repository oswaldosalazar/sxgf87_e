Hi, my name is John. I'm not really good at human relationships, like every
IT guy out there. I met her at work, she was a technician at the same floor.
 We started talking and we felt something between each other so we decided to
 have lunch at some point.

We met in a Vietnamese restaurant and sat down and ordered our drinks.
She ordered a honeydew boba and I a beer. I attempted to initiate small
talk but she abruptly interjected. She said “John, I’ve reported you to
Human Resources because to be honest you made me feel very uncomfortable.”
She then thanked me for the honeydew boba and left.

Luckily for me, I was the head of Human Resources. In my email reply to her complaint. I said "John has had a really rough story. He just comes from a messed up place. Orphaned at the age of six. His Foster parents were killed in a random
Buffalo watching accident"

He realized his life was void of love and close relationships. Suddenly, he had a flashback from his childhood. Oddly... it seemed liked a flashback to a different era. One he wasn't alive for. It seemed like the 1950's. A team of computer scientists were hovered over his body... as if they were pulling his insides out and operating on him from his belly. His flashabk abruptly ended. He touched his belly. It was hard. Sit ups did him good. Wait no--- he's couch potato. What? there's button on his belly? He pushed the button. A metal frame fell out and he realized his entire body was a network of circuits. He's a robot!!!
