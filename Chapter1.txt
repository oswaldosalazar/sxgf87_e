Hi, my name is John. I'm not really good at human relationships, like every
IT guy out there. I met her at work, she was a technician at the same floor.
 We started talking and we felt something between each other so we decided to
 have lunch at some point.

We met in a Vietnamese restaurant and sat down and ordered our drinks.
She ordered a honeydew boba and I a beer. I attempted to initiate small
talk but she abruptly interjected. She said “John, I’ve reported you to
Human Resources because to be honest you made me feel very uncomfortable.”
She then thanked me for the honeydew boba and left.

Luckily for me, I was head of Human Resources. In my email reply to her complaint
I said "John has had a really rough story. He just comes from a messed up place.
Orphaned at the age of six. His Foster parents were killed in a random
Buffalo watching accident"
